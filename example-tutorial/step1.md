The first step towards making your pipeline/module is having the code dockerized. Dockerizing your code allows you to

* make changes to your code with minimal or no changes to your module
* implement version control

For this tutorial, we shall be using a set of scripts present [here](https://github.com/DevangThakkar/dockerized_scripts/tree/master/example_scripts).
